"""Worker registry endpoints.

Implements the contract expected by the Windows Worker (clipping-windows-worker):
    POST /worker/register   — WorkerRegistration payload, upsert worker
    POST /worker/heartbeat  — Heartbeat payload, update state
    GET  /worker            — list workers
    GET  /worker/{id}       — get one worker

All endpoints (except health) require Bearer token.
